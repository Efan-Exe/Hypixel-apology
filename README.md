# Hypixel-apology



I used to have a horrid addiction to cheating in mainly videogames (e.g Minecraft, Roblox, Fortnite etc..) 
I would like to appologise as recently I have found a large amount of new friends that all truly enjoy hypixel
and other servers that I am on a quest to be unbanned on. I truly believe that I have changed and will try my
hardest to never break the rules again. I hope that my words will and have been truly looked into and I am 
hoping for the best.

Yours sincerely, Ethan Crain.
